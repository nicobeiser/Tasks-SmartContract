# Tasks-SmartContract
My first Solidity smart contract on Sepolia: a per-user To-Do List with priorities (1–5), statuses (Pending/InCourse/Completed), timestamps, CRUD operations, filtering by priority/state, and paginated listing. Emits TaskCreated/TaskUpdated/TaskDeleted/TaskStatusChanged events.
